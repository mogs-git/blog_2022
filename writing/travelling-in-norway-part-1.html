                            The entire trip had been planned in a frenzied, desperate week as I prepared to leave my job and make travel arrangements at the same time. Strangely, what originally spurred the trip was hearing back from a "wwoofing" farm in Norway, and from there I built in the hiking plans around it.

                        </p>

                            I was operating on a 'book the flight first, plan later', policy. Why was I putting myself through this? Why the need to travel, for no particular reason? Why didn't I have a great plan or friends to travel with?
                            <br><br>
                            The factors at play included a push- what else would I do in Sheffield if I were to stay? I imagined I would be bored, most of my friends would be working or had their summer holidays planned already. Another push was time constraints, when will I get 5 weeks of free time between jobs again? Perhaps not for some time. Finally, the pull, that feeling that throwing yourself into an unfamiliar situation can bring new things to life in a way you would never anticipate, and probably not encounter if you stay in the same place, seeing the same people, etc...  
                        </p>

                            I flew the day after my last day at work, finally getting into Oslo at 1.30am to stay in a tiny room right next to the railway line. The apartment was owned by an Indonesian woman who was extremely hospitable with my turning up so late, and even let my leave my bag after I'd checked out while I went kayaking the next day. Already, a small window into something new and opaque, catching a glimpse of what home means to another, stepping briefly into my host's life then out again in this strange formal-informal arrangement. Cooking in another person's kitchen always brings on a weird sensation of doing something taboo and also of discovery.

                            The next day I chanced my way onto a sea kayaking course in the afternoon. I immediately learned I could feel comfortable meeting new people, but I remember feeling a bit disappointed that I didn't immediately strike up any friendships with the others there. Post-dunk, I sat on the pier trying desparately to find an airbnb. It was now 5pm, and I was wondering if I'd find a place to stay at all, but finally found somewhere reasonably priced for the night.

                            The next morning I was out to catch the bus up to Jotunheim, saying bye to Oslo for now. There was a small window of good weather beginning the evening I arrived (it rained during the bus journey) meaning I could just about fit in two days of rain-free hiking. I planned to do Gjendesheim - Gjendebu via the Bessegen ridge and Memerubu, completing it as a loop coming back via Leirungsdalen.

                        They were two big days (both roughly 25km, the first day about 1800m ascent with quite technical sections) with a big backpack and little idea of what I was doing. In the above picture I think you can see the line in the lake separating glacial water and freshwater flows from either side of the valley, but I could be wrong.

                            The staff in Memerubu hut seemed reluctant to let me use their (empty) drying room for a couple of hours. This was to become a recurring theme, despite my protests that I was a DNT member AND wet. Eventually the staff relented and I managed to dry out my tent. Shortly after setting off it rained again and soaked one of my shirts and my shorts.

                            The second descent into Gjendebu involved downclimbing a series of ledges with chains set into them. Given that it had rained five minutes before I arrived, the rock was slick, and so were the chains. Weary and glad to be alive at the bottom, I trudged through some woods before finally arriving at Gjendebu. Resolute in getting as much use from my tent as possible, I left after having dinner at the hut and found a small pitch in some woods by some marshes, stressed at the lack of phone signal.

                        On the second day, I took so many detours to avoid snow, reindeer, deep rivers, etc... I ended up admitting defeat 4km from the destination mountain hut and hitchhiking back to Gjendesheim with a Dutch guy, whose car was so full of backpacking gear there wasn't really room for me, so his wife offered to wait by the road for 15 minutes while he sped me down to the hut (thanks again random Dutch couple!).
                        </p>
                        <p>
                         In classic form- rather than spending the evening with newfound friends after dinner, I stumbled out of the hut at 11.15pm with bloodshot, bleary eyes to find somewhere to wild camp in an attempt to save money. I'd washed my stinky clothes in the showers and left them in the hut drying room so was dressed in shorts, my pyjama top, and a light jumper, cursing the freezing cold 30mph gales and stumbling around looking for a sheltered spot by the lake. The next morning I was up early for another bus over to Rondane national park. I was the only passenger for the next 2 hours, leaving me wondering whether making it all up as I go along and avoiding doing things the "touristy" way might not in fact be worth it. <br><br>
                        Eventually I was in rainy Rondane for another few days hiking...
