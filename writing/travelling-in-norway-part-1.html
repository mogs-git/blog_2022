                        <p>On 30th June 2022 I left my job, and on 1st July set off for Norway.</p>

                        <p>About two weeks ago I set off on a last minute trip to Norway after leaving my job.</p>
                        <p>I flew the day after my last day at work, finally getting into Oslo at 1.30am to stay in a tiny room right next to the railway line in an apartment owned by an Indonesian woman and decorated in that style, leaving me wondering if I'd got the correct flight.</p>
                        <p>After a days rest (involving 3 hours of sea kayaking) I caught a bus up to Jotunheimen national park. <br><br>
                        These pictures are from a couple of days hiking around the Gjende lake.</p>
                        <div class="img-block">
                            <img src="../assets/travelling-in-norway-part-1/gjende.jpg" alt="tent under mountain">
                            <p class = "img-caption"></p>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                        They were two big days (both roughly 25km, the first day about 1800m ascent with quite technical sections) with a big backpack and little idea of what I was doing. In one picture I think you can see the line in the lake separating glacial water and freshwater flows from either side of the valley, but I could be wrong. <br><br>
                        On the second day, I took so many detours to avoid snow, reindeer, deep rivers, etc... I ended up admitting defeat 4km from the destination mountain hut and hitchhiking back to Gjendesheim with a Dutch guy, whose car was so full of backpacking gear there wasn't really room for me, so his wife offered to wait by the road for 15 minutes while he sped me down to the hut (thanks again random Dutch couple!). <br><br>
                         Rather than spending the evening with newfound friends after dinner, I stumbled out of the hut at 11.15pm with bloodshot, bleary eyes to find somewhere to wild camp in an attempt to save money. I'd washed my stinky clothes in the showers and left them in the hut drying room so was dressed in shorts, my pyjama top, and a light jumper, cursing the freezing cold 30mph gales and stumbling around looking for a sheltered spot by the lake. The next morning I was up early for another bus over to Rondane national park. I was the only passenger for the next 2 hours, leaving me wondering whether making it all up as I go along and avoiding doing things the "touristy" way might not in fact be worth it. <br><br>
                        Eventually I was in rainy Rondane for another few days hiking...</p>
