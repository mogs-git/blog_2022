                        I started this blog as a way to share ideas and as a portfolio for some my work. There are a few small, strange blogs that I have frequented over the years written by other travellers and backpackers,throwing stories into the ether. Those stories had some small but important influence on me, and for that reason I'd like to have a place to share stories of my own. I also like the step away from social media, having my own home-made blog on the "real" internet feels both old school cool and is a much better format for sharing stories than most popular apps. This isn't a professional blog aimed to sell myself to some company, it's just a way to share and document stories, ideas and odd bits of personal work I'm proud of. It's designed to be as minimalist as I can make it, most other blogs and themes available on "blog-making" websites or even using common web frameworks aren't anywhere near the level of minimalism I'd like so I designed and programmed this site myself using vanilla everything. I hope you like it and enjoy reading.
